# M8

This is the source code repository and issue tracker for 
[M8](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.rdnt.m8face), a WearOS watch-face.

M8 was initially conceived as a Samsung Watch Face Studio project, but it was later ported to
Kotlin and the new AndroidX/Jetpack APIs, so that its customization UI and capabilities can be on
par or close to the native Pixel Watch faces experience, in terms of look & feel as well as
performance.

M8's source code is released as open source under the MIT license and you are free to hack it,
use it as a base for your own watch face, study its code, submit feature requests or implement
features directly as Pull Requests (please reach out in case what you want to implement conflicts
with the existing implementation or future plans).

Please submit any issue or suggestion in the
[issues page](https://github.com/rdnt/m8/issues).  
If the issue is a bug, include your device model and steps required to reproduce, if any.
